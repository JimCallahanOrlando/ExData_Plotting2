# Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related 
# sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# How does one identify "coal combustion-related?

#Filtering the sources to the ones related to Coal Fuel Combustion
#Select data from the sources which are of the form "Fuel Comb - <string> - Coal"
#Example Fuel Comb - Electric Generation - Coal
#This is done based on the specification provided on the 
# epa website http://www.epa.gov/air/emissions/basic.htm

## Need to merge (join) NEI and SCC on scc 
## (see Jared Lander, "R for Everyone" page 142-149)
## Then need to subset coal combustion

# Subset before merging
